# Project-A
1st self-assigned project! Help me make the code more elegant!

I am a new programmer with an art background. I know a little HTML and am getting into JavaScript.

This is an attempt at a mouse-over animation. On mouse-over, after the entire sprite sheet is played, the last 4 cells loop back and forth.
(This should look like a flower blooming, and then rotating a little bit back and forth).

At mouse-out, the sprite sheet should show each cell backward starting at the current cell.
(This should look like a flower reverting to a bud).

I know there must be a much easier way to execute the same functionality.
If you submit any changes, please describe the new code to me as if I am a five year old, because I know very little at this point.
I haven't even used jQuery yet, so I don't know the basics of that, either.

Thank you for your effort, I really appreciate it!
